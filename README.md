Giphy API

I created a Fun App full of gifs using the giphy api!!!
Here is the documentation for the Giphy API
I made an array of Tv Show's and made buttons out of them.
When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
Yu can add a new action from the form on the right side of the page. The actions will be added to the array of actions and added as a new button
The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
